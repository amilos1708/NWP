		<figcaption>Rugby football was thought to have been started about 1845 at Rugby School in Rugby, Warwickshire, England although forms of football in which the ball was carried and tossed date to medieval times.</figcaption>

	<p>Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in North America and Oceania); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby union and rugby league; and Gaelic football.</p>
	<p>There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the world.</p>
	<p>The expansion and cultural influence of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly controlled Empire.[7] By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage..</p>
	<p>In 1888, The Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football associations.</p>
	<p>During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world.</p>
	<p>The various codes of football share certain common elements and can be grouped into two main classes of football: carrying codes like American football, Canadian football, Australian football, rugby union and rugby league, where the ball is moved about the field while being held in the hands or thrown, and kicking codes such as Association football and Gaelic football, where the ball is moved primarily with the feet, and where handling is strictly limited.</p>
