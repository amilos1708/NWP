	<p>Football (Soccer) is one of the oldest sports in the world and with that; it’s also one of the most recognised. The pinnacle of the international game comes in the form the Football World Cup.</p>
	<p>There are also tournament such as the Euro Championships, Copa America and the African Cup of Nations.</p>
	<p>Domestically the strongest leagues come from England (English Premier League), Spain (La Liga), Italy (Serie A) and Germany (Bundesliga). In parts of the world the sport is also known as Soccer.</p>
	<p>The aim of football is to score more goals then your opponent in a 90 minute playing time frame. The match is split up into two halves of 45 minutes.</p>
	<p>After the first 45 minutes players will take a 15 minute rest period called half time. The second 45 minutes will resume and any time deemed fit to be added on by the referee (injury time) will be accordingly.</p>
	<p>Each team consists of 11 players. These are made up of one goalkeeper and ten outfield players.</p>
	<p>The pitch dimensions vary from each ground but are roughly 120 yards long and 75 yards wide.</p>
	<p>On each pitch you will have a 6 yard box next to the goal mouth, an 18 yard box surrounding the 6 yard box and a centre circle.</p>
	<p>Each half of the pitch must be a mirror image of the other in terms of dimensions.</p>
	<p>Lets play!</a></p>';
